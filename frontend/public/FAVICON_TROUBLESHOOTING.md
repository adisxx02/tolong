# Favicon Troubleshooting Guide

If your favicon is not displaying correctly, here are some steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

## Fixes Already Applied

1. **Added Cache-Busting Parameters**: Added version parameters to favicon URLs (e.g., `favicon.ico?v=1`)
2. **Created Multiple Favicon Formats**: Added ICO, PNG, and Apple Touch Icon formats
3. **Added Web App Manifest**: Created a site.webmanifest file for better browser support
4. **Disabled Caching Headers**: Added meta tags to prevent browsers from caching favicon
5. **Ensured Correct File Naming**: Made sure files have correct names with proper casing

## Additional Troubleshooting Steps

If the favicon still isn't showing correctly, try these steps:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Press Ctrl+F5 (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) to force a refresh
   - Or clear your browser cache through the browser settings

2. **Check Dev Tools**:
   - Open browser developer tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect)
   - Go to the Network tab
   - Look for 404 errors related to favicon files

3. **Check File Formats**:
   - Make sure your favicon.ico is a valid ICO file format
   - The PNG files should be actual PNG images

4. **Try Different Browsers**:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Different browsers handle favicons differently

5. **Check Development Server**:
   - Restart your development server
   - Make sure it's serving the favicon files correctly

6. **Check Public Path Configuration**:
   - Ensure your build tool is correctly configured to serve files from public directory

7. **Check for Filename Case Sensitivity**:
   - Some servers are case-sensitive, so ensure file names match exactly

## Creating New Favicon Files

If you need to recreate your favicon files from scratch:

1. Go to [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
2. Upload your original pharmacy pill image
3. Download the generated package
4. Replace the files in the public directory
5. Force refresh your browser

## Manually Checking Favicon

You can manually check if your favicon is loading by entering these URLs directly in your browser:
- http://localhost:3000/favicon.ico
- http://localhost:3000/favicon.png
- http://localhost:3000/apple-touch-icon.png

(Replace localhost:3000 with your actual development server URL)
